## About The Project

Wine Quality Prediction Problem Statement: The dataset is related to white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. 

Attribute Information Input variables (based on physicochemical tests): 1 - fixed acidity 2 - volatile acidity 3 - citric acid 4 - residual sugar 5 - chlorides 6 - free sulfur dioxide 7 - total sulfur dioxide 8 - density 9 - pH 10 - sulphates 11 - alcohol Output variable (based on sensory data): 12 - quality (score between 0 and 10).

This is the example of the wine quality and water potability classification labeling them good or bad.
Wines with quality above 6 are classified as good and wines with quality 6 and below are classified as bad.
Water with potability 1 is classified as bad else is good.
